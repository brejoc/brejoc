Hi there! :wave: I'm Jochen aka brejoc, a Software Engineering Manager at Red Hat. Among other things I've been working on [Uyuni](https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni), [Salt](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/), and [Cobbler](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/) in the past. I was also a maintainer for [Salt on openSUSE](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/systemsmanagement:saltstack/salt).  
Right now I'm focusing on helping a new team at Red Hat to reach their full potential. I'm a maintainer for [teampulls on Fedora](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/teampulls), [Joker on openSUSE](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/devel:languages:clojure/joker), [goss on openSUSE](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/systemsmanagement/goss), [jpm on openSUSE](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/devel:languages:misc/jpm), and [mbpfan on openSUSE](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/hardware/mbpfan). I'm also a [openSUSE Member](https://connect.opensuse.org/pg/profile/brejoc) and a [Fedora packager](https://src.fedoraproject.org/user/brejoc/projects).
